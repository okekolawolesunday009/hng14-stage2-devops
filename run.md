DEVOPS TRACK - STAGE 2 Task: Containerize & Ship a Microservices Application

Hi Cool Keeds! Weldone on making it to Stage 2. Great run so far!

Overview
In Stage 1, you built and deployed a personal API on a live server using Nginx. In Stage 2, you will take a provided multi-service application and make it production-ready through containerization and a full CI/CD pipeline.

As a DevOps engineer, you will rarely be writing the application, but you will always be responsible for how it runs, how it gets there, and whether it survives a restart. This task puts that responsibility squarely on you.

The application is provided for you. It has bugs. Finding them is part of the task.

The Application
You are given a job processing system made up of three services:

A frontend (Node.js) where users submit and track jobs
An API (Python/FastAPI) that creates jobs and serves status updates
A worker (Python) that picks up and processes jobs from a queue
A Redis instance shared between the API and worker.
The source code is intentionally shipped with bugs — misconfigurations, bad practices, and missing production requirements are present throughout. You are not told where they are or how many there are. Finding them, fixing them, and documenting every single one is a graded part of this assessment.

Starter repo: https://github.com/chukwukelu2023/hng14-stage2-devops

Fork it. Do all your work in your fork.

What You Must Do
1. Fix the Application: Read through all the source files carefully before touching any infrastructure. Some things will not work correctly as written. Others will appear to work locally but fail inside containers. Document every issue you find in a FIXES.md file — state the file, the line, what the problem was, and what you changed. Vague entries will not receive marks.

2. Containerize It: Write a production-quality Dockerfile for each of the three services:

Use multi-stage builds where appropriate — your final image should not contain build tools or dev dependencies
All services must run as a non-root user
Each Dockerfile must include a working HEALTHCHECK instruction
No secrets, .env files, or credentials may be copied into any image


  Write a docker-compose.yml that brings the full stack up:

All services must communicate over a named internal network
Redis must not be exposed on the host machine
Services must only start after their dependencies are confirmed healthy — not just started
All configuration must come from environment variables, nothing hardcoded in the Compose file
Include CPU and memory limits for every service


3. Build the Pipeline: Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions on ubuntu-latest (free tier — no self-hosted runners, no paid services). Your pipeline must run the following stages in strict order:

lint → test → build → security scan → integration test → deploy


Lint: Python (flake8), JavaScript (eslint), and all Dockerfiles (hadolint)
Test: At least 3 unit tests for the API using pytest, with Redis mocked. Generate and upload a coverage report as a pipeline artifact
Build: Build all three images, tag each with the git SHA and latest, push to a local Docker registry running as a service container within the job
Security scan: Scan all images with Trivy, fail the pipeline on any CRITICAL severity finding, upload results as a SARIF artifact
Integration test: Bring the full stack up inside the runner, submit a job through the frontend, poll until it completes, assert the final status is correct, tear the stack down cleanly regardless of outcome
Deploy: Runs on pushes to main only. Must perform a scripted rolling update — the new container must pass its health check before the old one is stopped. If the health check does not pass within 60 seconds, abort and leave the old container running


A failure in any stage must prevent all subsequent stages from running.

4. Document It


A README.md that explains how to bring the entire stack up on a clean machine from scratch — list prerequisites, all commands, and what a successful startup looks like
A FIXES.md documenting every bug found — file, line number, what it was, and how you fixed it
A .env.example committed with placeholder values for every required variable


Rules

Your fork must be public. Private repositories will not be graded
Everything must be committed — nothing should only exist locally
.env must never appear in your repository or git history. This will cost you heavily
Do not hardcode secrets, passwords, or tokens anywhere — YAML files, Python, JavaScript, or git history all count
No cloud accounts required. This task runs entirely on your machine a️nd GitHub’s free tier
Do not open a pull request to the starter repo




IMPORTANT NOTE :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:
Thanos is not for testing, but for submitting work that has been fully tested on your local.

Submission:
When your repository is ready, head to stage-2-devops and use /submit. You will be asked for:

Your GitHub username
The full URL of your forked repository


You have 3 attempts. Read your report carefully before resubmitting, fix what failed, then try again.

Deadline: 11:59pm, Thursday, 23rd April, 2026

Good luck. If something in the application seems wrong, it probably is. :eyes: (edited) AirtableAirtable | Everyone's app platformAirtable is a low-code platform for building collaborative apps. Customize your
